Predict sales and demands for a retail company


## Business case

### Domain: Retail

Walmart is an American multinational retail store.

#### Business challenge: 
Business is facing challenges due to unforseen demands and runs out of stock occasionally.

#### Solution:
By taking into consideration factors like economic conditions including CPI(Customer Price Index), unemployment index etc. to predict sales and demands accurately can help in discovering the core issue.

#### What is CPI and why it is used?

- The consumer price index (CPI) is the instrument to measure inflation. It is used to estimate the average variation between two given periods in the prices of products consumed by households.
- It is closely followed by  policymakers, financial markets, businesses, and consumers.
- When the CPI is rising it means that consumer prices are also rising, and when it falls it means consumer prices are generally falling. In short, a higher CPI indicates higher inflation, while a falling CPI indicates lower inflation, or even deflation.

#### What role does Unemployment index play for businesses?

- This downturn in economic activity will directly affect businesses. Higher unemployment will mean that many households will have less income . For many businesses, this will result in lower sales as people spend less. However, the demand for some products and services will increase when unemployment is higher.

#### Why unforseen demands (also called "Demand shock") happen in bussiness? 

- A demand shock is a sudden unexpected event that dramatically increases or decreases demand for a product or service, usually temporarily. A positive demand shock is a sudden increase in demand, while a negative demand shock is a decrease in demand. Either shock will have an effect on the prices of the product or service.
